    "### Transmitter and Receiver Layout Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `layout_generate` function generates layouts of transmitters and receivers based on certain parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transmitter Layout Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transmitter Coordinates**:\n",
    "   - Transmitter coordinates $ (x_{i}, y_{i}) $ are randomly generated within a square field of length $L$: <br><br>\n",
    "     $ x_i \\sim U(0, L) $ <br><br>\n",
    "     $ y_i \\sim U(0, L) $ <br><br>\n",
    "   - A point in the field represents each transmitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Receiver Layout Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Receivers**:\n",
    "   - For each transmitter, a random number of receivers is generated, denoted as $ N_{rx\\_i} $, within a predefined range $ [\\text{minrx}, \\text{maxrx}] $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Receiver Coordinates**:\n",
    "   - For each receiver associated with transmitter `i`:\n",
    "     - A random distance `d` is generated within a predefined range $ [\\text{shortest\\_directLink\\_length}, \\text{longest\\_directLink\\_length}] $.\n",
    "     - An angle $ \\theta $ is randomly chosen within the range $ [0, 2\\pi] $.\n",
    "     - Receiver coordinates $ (x_{\\text{rx}\\_i}, y_{\\text{rx}\\_i}) $ are calculated relative to the transmitter location: <br><br>\n",
    "       $ x_{\\text{rx}_i} = x_i + d \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) $ <br><br>\n",
    "       $ y_{\\text{rx}_i} = y_i + d \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) $ <br><br>\n",
    "     - If the receiver coordinates fall within the field boundary, they are considered valid; otherwise, new coordinates are generated until a valid location is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Layout Representation**:\n",
    "   - The layout of receivers associated with each transmitter `i` is stored as a list of coordinate pairs $ [(x_{\\text{rx}_i}, y_{\\text{rx}_i})] $.\n",
    "   - Layouts for all transmitters are stored in a list `layout_rx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The `layout_generate` function generates layouts of transmitters and receivers within a given field based on random coordinate generation and specified parameters. It ensures that receiver locations are valid and within the field boundaries. This process forms the basis for simulating wireless communication scenarios in various applications.\n"

    "### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "- The function `distance_generate` calculates distances between transmitters and receivers using the refined summation formula.\n",
    "- It iterates over each transmitter-receiver pair and computes the Euclidean distance by summing the squares of differences in their coordinates.\n",

    "- Transmitter 1: $ (x_{1}, y_{1}) $\n",
    "- Transmitter 2: $ (x_{2}, y_{2}) $\n",
